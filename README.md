"LinkedCharts" is a framework for visual data exploration, built on top of [D3](http://d3js.org). 

Core aim is to allow 
users to rapidly set up "mini-apps" to explore their data set. These mini apps display the data in "linked" 
charts. By "linking", we mean that a user's interaction with one chart controls what another chart shows. For example, clicking
on a data point in a summary chart can show the data underlying this data point in the second plot.
