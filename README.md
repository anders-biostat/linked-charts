In the "linked-chart" project, we develop a framework for visual data exploration on top of [D3](http://d3js.org). 
Core aim is to allow 
users to rapidly set up "mini-apps" to explore their data set. These mini apps display the data in "linked" 
charts. By "linking", we mean that a user's interaction with one chart controls what another chart shows. For example, clicking
on a data point in a summary chart can show the data underlying this data point in the second plot.

The following example demonstrates how this looks in practice and how to code in "linked-charts":

A more complete documentation is work-in-progress.

If you already want to try out linked-charts, send us an e-mail (or give us a month or two to bundle everything uip nicely).
