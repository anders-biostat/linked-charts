# LinkedCharts
### Create interactive apps with just few lines of code!

<div class="gallery"></div>

"LinkedCharts" is a JavaScript framework for visual data exploration, built on top of [D3](http://d3js.org). 

It makes it easy to very rapidly set up "mini-apps" to explore a data set. These mini apps display the data in "linked" 
charts. By "linking", we mean that a user's interaction with one chart controls what another chart shows. Some of the 
examples you can find in the interactive gallery above. For each examle you can get R or JavaScript code used to generate.
You can also go to the tutorial page, where you can find detailed information about the example.

LinkedCharts can be used with JavaScript or from **R** statistical programmin environment. Use navigation buttons above
to learn more about each of the versions.
