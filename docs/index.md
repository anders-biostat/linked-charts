## LinkedCharts

### Create interactive apps with just few lines of code!

"LinkedCharts" is a framework for visual data exploration, built on top of [D3](http://d3js.org).
It is available as a JavaScript library or you can use it from **R** statistical programming environment. 

It makes it easy to very rapidly set up "mini-apps" to explore a data set. These mini apps display the data in "linked" 
charts. By "linking", we mean that a user's interaction with one chart controls what another chart shows.

To get a better grasp of how it works, check the interactive examples in the gallery bellow. For each examle 
you can get R or JavaScript code used to generate it.
You can also go to the tutorial page, where you can find detailed information about the example.

Click **R** or **Javascript** button in the navigation panel to get more information about each of the versions.
