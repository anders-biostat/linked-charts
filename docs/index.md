# LinkedCharts

"LinkedCharts" is a JavaScript framework for visual data exploration, built on top of [D3](http://d3js.org). 

It makes it easy to very rapidly set up "mini-apps" to explore a data set. These mini apps display the data in "linked" 
charts. By "linking", we mean that a user's interaction with one chart controls what another chart shows. For example, clicking
on a data point in a summary chart can show the data underlying this data point in the second plot.
