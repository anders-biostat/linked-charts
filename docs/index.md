# LinkedCharts
### Create interactive apps with just few lines of code!

<div class="gallery"></div>

"LinkedCharts" is a JavaScript framework for visual data exploration, built on top of [D3](http://d3js.org). 

It makes it easy to very rapidly set up "mini-apps" to explore a data set. These mini apps display the data in "linked" 
charts. By "linking", we mean that a user's interaction with one chart controls what another chart shows. For example,
click on the correlation heatmap above will cause the scatter plot to the right to show the underlying points.

LinkedCharts can be used with JavaScript or from **R** statistical programmin environment. Use navigation buttons above
to learn more about each of the versions.
