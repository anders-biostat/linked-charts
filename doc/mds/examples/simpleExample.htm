<h1>A very simple example</h1>

<p>To demonstrate how easy it is to create interactive data exploration apps with <i>linked-charts</i>,
we show here a very simple example, complete with the code needed to create it.</p>

<p>This example visualizes an excerpt of data from a project within <a href="https://www.fimm.fi/">FIMM</a>'s 
<a href="https://www.fimm.fi/en/research/grand-challenge-programmes/individualized-systems-medicine-cancer">Individualized
Systems Medicine</a> programme. From a cohort of (here) 52 patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), samples 
of tumour cells were acquired by means of bone marrow aspiration. Each sample was assayed by various means,
including RNA-Seq to measure gene expressions and an assay which tested the sensitivity of each sample
to a large panel of drugs. For the latter, aliqots of the samples were incubated with the drugs and 
then viability was measured.</p>

<p>For this example, we ask the simple question: Which drugs correlate with which genes?</p>

<p>For illustration purposes, the data was preselected to 10 drugs (all
topoisomerase inhibitors) and 35 genes. For each pair of a drug and a gene, the heat map
visualizes the Pearson correlation between the sensitivity of the drug and the expression of
the gene over all samples.</p>

<p>A correlation coefficient is merely a summary statistic. It is valuable to  be able to inspect the
underlying data. Here, a click on a heat map cells shows this underlying data in a scatter plot;
expression of the selected gene on the x axis, sensitivity to the selected drug on the y axis, each
point representing one sample.</p>

<p>This linking of a chart visualizing a summary statistic with a chart drilling down into the data of a specific
data element is a prototypical use case of <i>linked-charts</i>.</p>
</div>

<div class="comments">
<div class="expl" id="loadlib">
<p>Here we load the <i>linked-charts</i> library and its stylesheet. It comes bundled with 
<a href="https://d3js.org/">d3</a>, <a href="https://bl.ocks.org/Kcnarf/5c989173d0e0c74ab4b62161b33bb0a8">
d3-beeswarm plugin</a> and <a href="https://github.com/eligrey/FileSaver.js/">FileSaver.js</a></p></div>

<div class="expl" id="inputdata">
<p>There are various ways to load the data. Here, we demonstrate the simplest way:
just inline it into the page.</p>
<p>The data was originally an R matrix. We used the toJSON function of R's 'jsonlite' 
package to write out the data in a form that can be read in JavaScript, and copied and pasted
this here.</p>
<p>More about data input you can find <a href="../tutorials/data.html">here</a></p>
</div>

<div class="expl" id="labelvectors">
The labels for the heatmap will be taken from these two string vectors. The vectors
have lengths 35 and 10, but some of the elements have been omitted to not clutter the page. 
</div>

<div class="expl" id="matrices">
The main data are given in these two data matrices. The first contains
35 &times; 52 gene expression values for 35 genes (matrix rows) times
52 samples (matrix columns). The second contains drug response scores for 10 drugs
times the same 52 samples.</div>

<div class="expl" id="table">
The layout of a set of linked charts is specified by writing a normal web page
in standard HTML. Here, our page merely contains one table with one row and
two table data (&lt;td>) elements, each of which will take up one of the charts.
Further below, we will refer to these &lt;td> by the <code>id</code> attributes
that are set here.</div>

<div class="expl" id="mainscript">
This is the actual user script to use the <i>linked-charts</i> library. 
</div>

<div class="expl" id="vars">
<p>These two global variables provide the link between the heatmap and the scatter plot:</p>
<p>They always show the row number (gene) and column number (drug) of the last heatmap cell
on which the user has clicked (or, initially, 0, i.e., the top-left cell).</p>
</div>

<div class="expl" id="scatter1">
<p>Here, we initialize a <a>scatter</a> object. This is one of the standard chart 
<a href="tutorials">types</a> provided by our <i>linked-charts</i> library.</p>
<p>In the following lines, we set the object's <a href="tutorials">properties</a></p>
</div>

<div class="expl" id="xy">
<p>Linked-charts uses call-back functions to access the data: These two functions are called for
each data point, being passed the number of the data point as argument. They look up the gene 
expression and drug response score in the input matrices, looking at the column for sample <code>k</code>.<p> 
<p>The global variables defined above are consulted, so that the scatter plot uses the data from the rows
corresponding to gene and drug selected by the user's last click on the heatmap.</p>
<p>Axes and scaling is automatically adjusted to the value range (but this can be overridden).</p>
<p>Besides <a href="scatter">x</a> and <a href="scatter">y</a> coordinates, other properties of the 
data points such as <a href="layer">colour</a>, <a>size</a> etc, can 
be set similarly, either globally for all points by providing constants, or for each point separately.</p> 
</div>

<div class="expl" id="place">
<p>The <a href="chart">place</a> function inserts the object into the web page. The argument is a CSS selector,
here selecting the table elements that were marked with <code>id</code> attributes as the places to
take up the charts.</div>

<div class="expl" id="heatmap1">
<p>Here, we instantiate the second chart, namely the heatmap on the left. The <a>heatmap</a> is another
of the standard chart <a href="tutorials">types</a> provided by the <i>linked-charts</i> library.</div>

<div class="expl" id="hm_prop">
<p>Here, we set the basic properties of the heatmap: The numbers of rows (<a>nrows</a>) and columns
(<a>ncols</a>), and the <a href="chart">height</a> and <a href="chart">width</a> (in pixels).</p>
<p>The number of rows (number of genes) and columns (number of drugs) is read off from the number 
of rows of the two data arrays.</div>

<div class="expl" id="hm_col">
<p>We use <a href="https://github.com/d3/d3-scale-chromatic#interpolateRdBu">one of D3's color palettes</a> 
for the heatmap's colour scale. These colours should map
the correlation values, which range from -1 to 1.</p></div>

<div class="expl" id="hm_value">
<p>As do all charts in the linked-charts library, heatmaps access their data via callback functions. For
this, the property <a href="heatmap">value</a> has to be set to a function that takes two arguments, <code>rowId</code> and
<code>colId</code> and returns the value that the cell with the given position should show.</p>
<p>Here, we provide a function that looks up the data row corresponding to <code>rowId</code> in 
the <code>geneExpr</code> matrix and the data row corresponding to <code>colId</code> in 
the <code>drugScore</code> matrix. It then calculates for these two row vectors Pearson's correlation coefficient
and returns it.</p>
<p>This example shows that it is not necessary to bring the data into a specific form to display it with
<i>linked-charts</i>. Thanks to the call-back mechanism, we can code access to the data in whatever form it is provided
and even do small calculations on the fly.
</p></div>

<div class="expl" id="rowcolnames">
<p>The row and column labels displayed at the side of the heatmap are also provided by call-back functions,
which are called individually for each row and each column.</p>
<p>In our input data, the mapping of rows of the input data matrices to gene and drug names is provided
by two vectors of labels, which are accessed here.</p>
</div>

<div class="expl" id="click">
<p>The property <a href="heatmap">on_click</a> is set here to a call back function that is called whenever the user
clicks on a cell.</p>
<p>The function takes the row and column index of the clicked heatmap cell from the provided arguments
and saves them in the two global variables <code>selGene</code> and <code>selDrug</code> that we have 
defined at the top and which are read by
the scatter plot's <a>x</a> and <a>y</a> call-backs. </p>
<p>Then, the <a href="chart">update</a> function of the scatter chart is called. This has to be done whenever the
data or appearance of a plot changed and the plot has to be re-rendered.</p>
<p>This simple and transparent style of linking two plots is the heart of <i>linked-charts</i>.</p>
