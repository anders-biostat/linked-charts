<div class="comments">
<div class="expl" id="skip">
<p>Some lines of code, that have been already described in the previous examples, were omitted 
for the sake of simplicity. At the bottom of the page you can find the complete code.</p>
</div>

<div class="expl" id="heatmap">
<p>The <a>heatmap</a> is set exactly as it was done in the previous example. So here, all its properties were omitted
for the sake of simplisity</p>
</div>

<div class="expl" id="get_curve">
<p>In this dataset for each sample we have all the parameters of the fitted sigmoid curve: the lower asymptote 
(<code>min</code>), the upper asymptote (<code>max</code>), the growth rate (<code>slope</code>) and the inflection point
(<code>IC50</code>). Using these parameters, here we define the <code>get_curve</code> function that returns 
the value of the fitted curve at 
point <code>x</code>. All drugs were tested at five different concentrations, each 10 times
higher than the previous one. On the scatter plot x-values are numbers from 0 to 4, which correspond to log10 of each 
concentration divided by minimal tested concentration.</p>
</div>

<div class="expl" id="scatter">
<p>Now both scatter plots are parts of charts that have several layers. Note, that setting an ID for a layer is 
optional. For instance, the ID of scatter plot layer on the first plot will be automatically set to <code>layer0</code></p>
</div>

<div class="expl" id="aspectRatio">
<p>Here, we fix the aspect ratio for x and y axes to 1.</p>
</div>

<div class="expl" id="colourValue">
<p>Besides defining colours for each point directly (using <a href="layer">colour</a> property), one can set colours by providing a 
value for each data point, so that points with the same colour value will have the same colour. Numeric colour values will 
generate a continuous colour scale, while strings will define a categorical colour scale.</p>
<p>Here, for each point we calculate the squared root of sum of squared residuals for the selected cell line and both selected 
drug and use this value to define colours.</p>
</div>

<div class="expl" id="palette">
<p>The default set of colours for a continuous colour scale is <a href="https://github.com/d3/d3-scale-chromatic#schemeSpectral">
<code>d3.schemeSpectral</code></a>, which goes from red to blue through 
yellow. You can change that, setting the <a href="layer">palette</a> property to any other 
<a href="https://github.com/d3/d3-scale-chromatic">d3.interpolator</a> or any <a href="https://github.com/d3/d3-scale">d3.scale</a>
that will transform some numeric range or a set of strings into a set of
colours. Another option is to provide this property with an array of colours as it is shown here. This array will be used as
a range for the <a href="layer">colourScale</a>. 
We want "bad" examples to be coloured red, "nice" to be green, suspicious - yellow.</p>
</div>

<div class="expl" id="colourRange">
<p>By default the domain of the <a href="layer">colourScale</a> is defined as the range that encompasses all the colour values 
of the data points. So 
even if for a certain pair of drugs there is no badly fitted samples, some of the dots still will be coloured red. To address this 
we can manually defined the domain that will be fixed for all drugs. Now all the points with colour values close to zero 
will be green, while all with values around 30 and higher - red.</p>
</div>

<div class="expl" id="line1">
<p><a>xLine</a> is another basic type of plots that are implemented in the <tt>linked-charts</tt> library. It can display one 
or several lines, defined as <i>y = f(x)</i> functions. Scatter plots and lines can not be put on one layer, so if you want 
to have them both on one chart, you need create several layers.</p>
<p>Here, we add a diagonal line to the plot.</p>
</div>

<div class="expl" id="line2">
<p><a>xLine</a> is another basic type of plots that are implemented in the <tt>linked-charts</tt> library. It can display one 
or several lines, defined as <i>y = f(x)</i> functions. Scatter plots and lines can not be put on one layer, so if you want 
to have them both on one chart, you need create several layers.</p>
<p>Here, we add add fitted curves for both drugs to the plot.</p>
</div>

<div class="expl" id="lineFun1">
<p>Each line in <a>xLine</a> charts should be defined as <i>y = f(x)</i> function. This is done by setting <a>lineFun</>
property. This should be a function with two arguements: the first one is an x value, the second is an ID of the line.
The function should return the corresponding y value.</p>
<p>Here, we have only one line <i>y = x</i> and thus the second argument is omitted.</p>
</div>

<div class="expl" id="place">
<p>The <a href="chart">place</a> function inserts the object into the web page. The argument is a CSS selector,
here selecting the table elements that were marked with <code>id</code> attributes as the places to
take up the charts.</p>
<p>Each plot is placed into a separate <code>div</code> element, so one can place several charts into one 
element. Here, both scatterplots are placed into a single table cell.</p>
<p>Here, <a href="chart">place</a> is used after all the layers are defined. This is the recomended way to do it. Another option
is to use the <a>placeLayer</a> method for each layer added after <a href="chart">place</a> has been 
called. Note, that calling <a href="chart">place</a> function twice will result in creating multiple instances.</p>
</div>

<div class="expl" id="npoints2">
<p>Here, we want to make the same scatter with individual values of inhibition for both selected drugs and all the 
tested concentrations as in the previous example, but putting all the points on a single layer. So the number of points
for each case will be 10.</p>
</div>

<div class="expl" id="npoints3">
<p>Number of lines is set by the same property as number of points in scatter plots. And in the same manner, instead 
of setting the number of lines, one can define a set of all IDs via <a>elementIds</a> property.</p>
<p>Here, we add two curves (for both selected drugs) sumultaniously.</p>
</div>

<div class="expl" id="xy">
<p>In the previous example, points, corresponding to each drug, were added separately, using two layers. Here, we show,
how to do it in one layer. Now we have 10 points with IDs from 0 to 9. The first five (with IDs from 0 to 4) correspond 
to the first selected drug, while the second five - to the second selected drug. So we use remainder from devision of 
the index <code>k</code> by 5 as x value, and the floored value of <code>k / 5</code> as an indicator, which of the 
two selected drugs we are looking at.</p>
</div>

<div class="expl" id="colour1">
<p>In the previous example we used the <a href="layer">colour</a> property to set one colour for all the points in the 
layer. Otherwise, the <a href="layer">colour</a> property can be defined by a callback function that takes an ID of the point  
returns colour (as name, RGB or HEX value). Note, that setting colours directly via <a href="layer">colour</a> option overrides 
<a>colourValue</a> and <a href="layer">palette</a> properties.</p>
<p>Here, if the ID <code>k</code> is greater than 4, the correspoding dot will be red, otherwise - blue.</p>
</div>

<div class="expl" id="lineFun2">
<p>Each line in <a>xLine</a> charts should be defined as <i>y = f(x)</i> function. This is done by setting <a>lineFun</>
property. This should be a function with two arguements: the first one is an x value, the second is an ID of the line.
The function should return the corresponding y value.</p>
<p>Here, we use the previously defined function <code>get_curve</code> and use the current values of the global variables
<code>selDrugs</code> and <code>selCellLine</code> to show the right curves.</p>
</div>

<div class="expl" id="colour2">
<p>Here, we just make the first line blue and the other - red.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="description">
<h1>Lines and Colour</h1>
<p>This is one of the series of examples, where we step by step introduce new chart properties for the
same set of charts.</p>
<p>Here, we show how to draw line plots. Let's add a diogonal line to the upper scatter plot and fitted curves
for both drugs to the bottom one. We also use colour to indicate the samples, where curvefitting wasn't succesfull.
Red dots on the correlation scatterplots show cell lines with bad fitting for at least one of the two selected drugs.</p>
<p>The data used here are generated in a drug-screening experiment. 50 drugs at 5 different concentrations 
were tested against 21 pancreatic cancer cell lines. The heatmap shows drug-drug correlation. Like in the 
previous example, a click on a cell of the heatmap reveals the underlying statistics by demonstrating on 
the scatter plot (right upper corner) the values of avarage inhibition for all tested cell lines and the two
selected drugs. By clicking on a data point one can select a cell line, and thus change the third plot 
(right bottom corner) that demonstrates individual inhibition percent values for the two selected drugs and 
the selected cell line.</p>
